  abstract = {We introduce a statistical model for microarray gene expression data
	that comprises data calibration, the quantification of differential
	expression, and the quantification of measurement error. In particular,
	we derive a transformation h for intensity measurements, and a difference
	statistic Deltah whose variance is approximately constant along the
	whole intensity range. This forms a basis for statistical inference
	from microarray data, and provides a rational data pre-processing
	strategy for multivariate analyses. For the transformation h, the
	parametric form h(x)=arsinh(a+bx) is derived from a model of the
	variance-versus-mean dependence for microarray intensity data, using
	the method of variance stabilizing transformations. For large intensities,
	h coincides with the logarithmic transformation, and Deltah with
	the log-ratio. The parameters of h together with those of the calibration
	between experiments are estimated with a robust variant of maximum-likelihood
	estimation. We demonstrate our approach on data sets from different
	experimental platforms, including two-colour cDNA arrays and a series
	of Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays.},

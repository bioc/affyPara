affyPara in a R package providing parallelized functions for exploratory oligonucleotide array analysis.
The package is designed for large numbers of microarray data, but could be used for small data sets too.

The package requires a running computer cluster and the R package SNOW (Simple Network of Workstations,
>= 0.2-3, http://www.stat.uiowa.edu/~luke/R/cluster/). Snow can use one of three communications mechanisms: 
sockets, PVM, or MPI.

There is no testcode included in the subdirectory test. Because for testing a running computer cluster is 
required. A wide testcode is available. Please contact the maintainer.
